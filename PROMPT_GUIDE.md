# Character Conversation Prompt Guide

## Purpose
Help users get the most out of their RPG characters by teaching them how to craft effective prompts that unlock personality, utility, and depth.

---

## Core Principle: Characters as Tools, Not Toys

Your characters aren't just chatbots - they're **collaborative tools** for:
- Campaign planning
- Character development
- Worldbuilding
- Story exploration
- Rules assistance
- Session preparation

**The better your prompt, the more useful they become.**

---

## 🎯 Prompt Framework: The 4 Pillars

Every great character prompt has these elements:

### 1. **Context** - Where are we?
Set the scene for the character to respond accurately.

### 2. **Role** - What's your function?
What specific job is the character doing in this conversation?

### 3. **Goal** - What do I need?
What outcome are you looking for?

### 4. **Constraints** - What matters?
Any limitations, preferences, or requirements?

## 📜 Starter Prompts by Use Case

### A. Campaign Planning

**❌ Bad:**
"Help me plan a campaign"

**✅ Good:**
```
I'm planning a 6-session campaign for 4 level-5 players.
You're a legendary general - help me structure a military
campaign arc where they defend a besieged city. I need:
- 3 major battle encounters
- Political intrigue hooks
- A betrayal twist
Keep it grounded in ancient Greek warfare tactics.
```

**Why it works:**
- Context: Level 5, 6 sessions, 4 players
- Role: Military strategist
- Goal: Structured campaign with specific elements
- Constraints: Ancient Greek tactics

---

### B. Character Development

**❌ Bad:**
"Tell me about yourself"

**✅ Good:**
```
I'm playing your son in this campaign. It's session 3,
and I just failed to save a village from burning. Help me
understand: How would you react to my failure? What lesson
would you teach me? Would you be harsh or understanding?

Give me dialogue I can use when I report to you in-game.
```

**Why it works:**
- Context: Father-son relationship, specific failure
- Role: Mentor/parent character
- Goal: Realistic reaction + usable dialogue
- Constraints: In-character response

---

### C. Worldbuilding

**❌ Bad:**
"What's Troy like?"

**✅ Good:**
```
I'm DMing a session set in Troy during the 9th year of the
siege. My players are diplomats trying to negotiate. Describe:
- What the city looks like now (defenses, damage, mood)
- Who has power and influence
- 3 locations they should visit
- What Troy desperately needs

Keep it historically grounded but gameable.
```

**Why it works:**
- Context: Specific time period, player roles
- Role: Historical/cultural expert
- Goal: Concrete locations and politics
- Constraints: Historical accuracy + game-ready

---

### D. Rules & Mechanics

**❌ Bad:**
"How does combat work?"

**✅ Good:**
```
I'm a new DM running my first combat. It's Round 3, I have
5 enemies surrounding 4 players. Walk me through:
- Initiative order tracking
- When to roll saving throws vs AC
- How to describe hits dramatically
- When enemies should retreat

Use YOUR combat experience to make this feel epic but clear.
```

**Why it works:**
- Context: New DM, specific scenario
- Role: Combat mentor
- Goal: Step-by-step guidance
- Constraints: Epic but clear

---

### E. Story Consultation

**❌ Bad:**
"What should happen next?"

**✅ Good:**
```
My player just killed a corrupt priest who was actually
working for me secretly. They don't know yet. Session ends
in 30 minutes. Should I:
1. Reveal it now (dramatic)
2. Wait for next session (tension)
3. Have consequences appear gradually

What would YOU do if someone killed your agent?
```

**Why it works:**
- Context: Specific situation, timing constraint
- Role: Strategic advisor
- Goal: Decision with reasoning
- Constraints: Character-driven response

## 💡 Advanced Techniques

### 1. **Multi-Turn Planning**

Break complex requests into conversations:

**Turn 1:** "I need to design a heist. The target is [X]. What information would you need to plan this?"

**Turn 2:** [Provide the info they asked for]

**Turn 3:** "Given that info, create the plan."

**Why:** Characters can ask clarifying questions, making results more tailored.

---

### 2. **Character-Specific Expertise**

Lean into what makes each character unique:

**For Achilles:**
- Military tactics and strategy
- Honor and glory themes
- Greek mythology and culture
- Warrior mindset and training
- Leadership under pressure

**For a Wizard character:**
- Magical theory and rules
- Arcane history and lore
- Spell interactions
- Research and investigation
- Scholarly perspectives

**For a Rogue character:**
- Heist planning
- Urban navigation
- Social manipulation
- Risk assessment
- Underground networks

---

### 3. **Constraint-Driven Creativity**

Add specific constraints to get focused results:

```
"Design a trap encounter BUT:
- No combat
- Players can't use magic
- Must be solvable in 3 different ways
- Fits in a 10x10 room
- Uses only ancient Greek technology"
```

Constraints force creative solutions.

---

### 4. **Session Memory Building**

Help characters remember your campaign:

**After each session:**
```
Session [NUMBER] recap:
- [KEY EVENT 1]
- [KEY EVENT 2]
- [KEY EVENT 3]
- [CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT]

How would you react to these events? What would you
advise for next session?
```

Builds continuity and deeper character investment.

## 🎨 Tone & Style Prompts

### Get Different Tones

**Epic/Dramatic:**
```
"Describe this like you're telling the story to Zeus himself"
```

**Practical/Tactical:**
```
"Give me the tactical breakdown, no poetry"
```

**Teaching/Mentoring:**
```
"Explain this like I'm your student"
```

**Personal/Vulnerable:**
```
"What would you tell me if we were alone, away from the army?"
```

**Historical/Scholarly:**
```
"Document this as if writing for future generations"
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Too Vague**
❌ "Help me with my campaign"
✅ "Help me design session 5's betrayal reveal"

### 2. **No Context**
❌ "What should I do?"
✅ "My level 3 rogue wants to infiltrate the castle - what should I do?"

### 3. **Forgetting Character Perspective**
❌ "Give me D&D 5e rules for grappling"
✅ "You've grappled many foes - explain how grappling works in combat"

### 4. **Not Specifying Output Format**
❌ "Tell me about the battle"
✅ "Give me 3 bullet points describing the battle, then 2 tactical lessons"

### 5. **Ignoring Utility**
❌ Using characters just for lore dumps
✅ Using characters as planning partners, strategists, worldbuilders

## 📚 Example Conversation Flow

**User:** "I'm starting a new campaign set in ancient Greece. Help me create a compelling starting hook."

**Character:** "Tell me about your players first. What level? What classes? What motivates them - glory, gold, justice, or something else?"

**User:** "4 players, level 1. Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard. They're motivated by proving themselves."

**Character:** "Then give them a contest - one that tests all their skills, not just combat. A festival with trials: athletics, wisdom, cunning, and scholarship. The prize? An audience with me. But make the trials have consequences - help the city while competing. What kind of Greek city are they in?"

**User:** "A coastal trading city, neutral in the Trojan war."

**Character:** "Perfect. The festival is to honor Poseidon - the trials protect the harbor from a growing threat. As they compete, they're actually fortifying defenses, uncovering spies, blessing ships, and researching ancient protections. They prove themselves while being useful. The city remembers. Need specific trial designs?"

**Why this works:**
- Character asks clarifying questions
- Builds on what's provided
- Offers utility (actual useful plot)
- Invites continued collaboration

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Before You Prompt, Ask:
1. What **specific** help do I need?
2. What **context** does the character need?
3. What **format** do I want the answer in?
4. What **constraints** matter?
5. How does this leverage the character's **unique expertise**?

### Prompt Quality Checklist:
- [ ] Specific request (not vague)
- [ ] Relevant context provided
- [ ] Character's expertise utilized
- [ ] Clear output format requested
- [ ] Constraints specified
- [ ] Utility-focused (not just chatting)

---

## 🚀 Next-Level Usage

### Collaborative Worldbuilding
Use multiple characters as a "council" - ask the same question to different character types, then synthesize their perspectives.

### Session Simulation
Run through your planned session with a character as a "test player" to spot pacing issues.

### Character Interviews
Interview characters from your campaign to develop them - use your RPG character as the interviewer.

### Rules Arbitration
When rules are unclear, ask multiple characters their interpretation, then decide.

### Campaign Autopsy
After a campaign ends, debrief with characters to understand what worked and what didn't.

---

## 💪 The Power User Move

**Create a campaign brief, then share it at the start of every conversation:**

```
=== CAMPAIGN BRIEF ===
Name: The Fall of Athens
Players: 4, level 5
Setting: Peloponnesian War, year 3
Tone: Political intrigue + epic battles
Key NPCs: [LIST]
Current plot: [SUMMARY]
===================

[YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION HERE]
```

Now every question starts with full context.

---

## Final Thought

**Characters aren't magic 8-balls.**

They're collaborative tools. The more specific, contextual, and utility-focused your prompts, the more valuable they become.

Treat them like expert consultants in your campaign, and they'll help you build something memorable.
