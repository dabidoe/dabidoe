Human: I want a comprehensive summary of what we've built and how to proceed. Can you create a single document that explains:

1. What we've created so far in the clean repo
2. The full 5e functionality we're extracting from test HTML
3. Exact components we need to build
4. How it all connects to the Gemini/MongoDB backend
5. Mobile-first approach
6. Complete implementation roadmap

Make it actionable for my dev.
